Attempt Run a build as a user who triggered it, optionally breaking the Credentials Plugin sandbox to allow access to user specific credentials.
If the build was triggered as a downstream build, the build runs as a user who triggered the upstream build.
This does not work when the build is triggered by SCM polling or scheduled triggering. The build runs as SYSTEM authorization in those cases.
